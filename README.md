# EEE3097S
This will be our shared repository for our EEE3097S 2021 project.

This project is an extension of the buoy model design which would be installed on the pancake ice in the Southern Ocean in order to gather data on the ice for further research purposes. The aim is to design an ARM based IP to compress and encrypt data from an IMU sensor found in the SHARC Buoy.
